***Security Misconfigurations include***:
1) Poorly configured permissions on cloud services
2) Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges
3) Default accounts with unchanged passwords
4) Error messages that are overly detailed and allow an attacker to find out more about the system
5) Not using HTTP security headers, or revealing too much detail in the Server: HTTP header

**NOTE:** This vulnerability can often lead to more vulnerabilities, such as default credentials giving you access to sensitive data, XXE or command injection on admin pages.
