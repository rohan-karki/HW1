***OWASP Zap*** (***Zed Attack Proxy***) is a security testing framework which is used for robust enumeration of web applications.

***Benefits of using OWASP ZAP over Burp Suite:***

1) ***Automated Web Application Scan:*** This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities.
2) ***Web Spidering:*** You can passively build a website map with Spidering.
3) ***Unthrottled Intruder:*** You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle.

**Applications of OWASP ZAP:**

1) Automated and Manual scan
2) Directory brute forcing
3) Brute-force web logins
