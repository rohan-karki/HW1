## Reverse Shells vs Bind Shells:

- In a reverse shell, the target machine tries to connect to the attacker's machine. There is a listener setup on the attacker's machine, which catches the connection request sent by the target machine.

- In a bind shell, a port is opened on the target machine which acts as a listener, and the attacker machine connects to that port.

## Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads:

- **Non-Staged Payload** sends exploit shellcode all at once, hence it is larger in size. This type of payload doesn't always work.

- **Staged Payload** sends shellcode in stages, which can be less stable.

**NOTE:** Non-Staged payload is denoted as ==**_`meterpreter_reverse_tcp`_**==, and Staged payload is denoted as ==**_`meterpreter/reverse_tcp`_**==

## Brute Force Attacks:

**Hydra** can be used to brute force usernames and passwords for a service hosted on a target machine.

**SYNTAX**: ==**_`hydra -l <username> -P <password list> <service>://<target IP>`_**==

==**_`hydra -L <username list> -p <password> <service>://<target IP>`_**==

==**_`hydra -C <wordlist> -4 <service>://<target IP>`_**==

**NOTE:** The **_`-C`_** flag is used when a wordlist uses colon separated **_username:password_** format, and the **_-4_** is used to specify IPv4 address for the target.
